# IST_687_ANALYZING-HEALTHCARE-COST-INFORMATION-FROM-A-HMO-
This project predicts healthcare costs for HMO customers by analyzing factors like age, BMI, and smoking status. Using data cleaning, EDA, and models like SVM and Regression Tree, it identifies cost drivers and offers actionable insights. An interactive Shiny app presents findings to support targeted wellness programs and cost reduction.


This project focused on analyzing the drivers behind high healthcare expenses within the U.S., using data provided by a Health Management Organization (HMO). The process began with rigorous data cleaning to ensure robust and reliable analysis, reflecting the importance of data integrity in the field of data science. Through this initial stage, I honed essential skills in handling missing values and preparing data, critical competencies in managing and transforming data effectively.

In the exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase, we uncovered key insights into how various demographic factors—such as age, BMI, smoking status, and physical activity levels—affect healthcare costs. By examining these variables in relation to expenditures, we were able to identify significant patterns that can help inform actionable strategies. This phase reinforced the role of EDA in deriving data-driven insights that have practical value across different applications.

For predictive modeling, we developed and implemented Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Regression Tree models to classify individuals based on their expected healthcare costs with high accuracy. These models not only marked a technical achievement but also provided valuable tools for the HMO to design targeted interventions aimed at cost reduction.
A notable component of this project involved creating a Shiny app to present our findings, making the data and models more accessible and interactive. This step underscored the practical application of R for creating data products that enhance user engagement and understanding through visualization.

Our recommendations were designed to encourage healthy lifestyles, with careful consideration of ethical aspects such as fairness, minimizing biases, and safeguarding privacy in our models and proposed actions. This ethical reflection emphasized the importance of responsible data use and model evaluation in delivering unbiased and respectful recommendations.

In summary, this project was a comprehensive application of data science skills, blending technical and ethical considerations with the practical goal of informing healthcare cost management. It provided a hands-on opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge, contributing valuable insights to the healthcare field while emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of data science.


•	Goals of the Project: The main goal was to analyze the factors contributing to high healthcare costs in the U.S. and develop predictive models that can help a Health Management Organization (HMO) identify cost drivers. This involved both exploring significant demographic and lifestyle variables and creating actionable recommendations to manage these costs effectively.

•	Technologies Used:
o	Data Cleaning and Analysis: R programming for data preparation and cleaning, handling missing values, and managing large datasets.
o	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Various R packages for visualizations and statistical analyses to uncover trends related to healthcare expenses.
o	Predictive Modeling: R for implementing Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Regression Tree models to classify individuals based on projected healthcare costs.
o	Visualization and Reporting: A Shiny app was developed in R to present our findings interactively, allowing stakeholders to engage with the data and model outputs.
•	Actionable Insight Generated:
o	Key insights were generated regarding the impact of demographic factors—such as age, BMI, smoking status, and physical activity—on healthcare costs, identifying high-risk groups that drive higher expenses. These insights were essential for the HMO to create targeted wellness programs and design interventions for cost reduction.
o	The predictive models offered a practical tool for classifying individuals based on expected costs, providing a foundation for cost-effective healthcare management.
•	Specific Contribution:
o	Data Cleaning: Led the initial data preprocessing efforts, ensuring that missing values were handled appropriately and data integrity was maintained for robust analysis.
o	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth EDA to identify relationships between variables, including visualizations that highlighted the impact of lifestyle and demographic factors on costs.
o	Modeling and Validation: Actively worked on implementing and tuning the SVM and Regression Tree models, achieving a high level of accuracy in predicting cost categories.
o	Shiny App Development: Contributed to designing and creating the Shiny app, making data insights more accessible to the HMO's stakeholders.
